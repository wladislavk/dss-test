Test Task for DSS
=================

This repo includes a small file that is a part of real project code. Currently this file is requested via
AJAX.

Create a small Laravel instance and rewrite `check_logout.php` as an API endpoint, include automated tests. 
User ID is to be passed as a part of URL. There is no need to set up a database, the DB query may be stubbed
in tests. `Db::getRow()` method retrieves the first row of the query result. Upload the result into a new 
Github repo.
